#This programmer bitbangs GPIO lines using the Linux sysfs GPIO interface
#
#To enable it set the configuration below to match the GPIO lines connected to the
#relevant ISP header pins and uncomment the entry definition. In case you don't
#have the required permissions to edit this system wide config file put the
#entry in a separate <your name>.conf file and use it with -C+<your name>.conf
#on the command line.
#
#To check if your avrdude build has support for the linuxgpio programmer compiled in,
#use -c?type on the command line and look for linuxgpio in the list. If it's not available
#you need pass the --enable-linuxgpio=yes option to configure and recompile avrdude.
